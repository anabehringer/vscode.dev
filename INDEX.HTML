Break away
From the path
Preordained
I'll take away
All your pride
And your rage
I'll swoop in and take you out
Gonna give in, just let it all out
Don't hesitate, just fall into me, my girl
You curved me enough, I'm goin' all out
I'll reach in your chest to pull your heart out
Don't hesitate, just fall into me, my girl
The stars collide
When you and I
Intertwine
For the first time
The stars collide
When you and I
Intertwine
For the first time
Look at me now, listen to what I have to say
See now? Keep this shit up and I'm gon' break
Don't want you hearin' anybody else (nobody else)
If you're not with me, then you're by yourself (by yourself)
Why even talk to anyone else when I'm here?
Act like I don't see it but I'm watching you
Don't even look at anyone else when I'm here
I don't wanna see it but I always do
I'll swoop in and take you out
Gonna give in, just let it all out
Don't hesitate, just fall into me, my girl
You curved me enough, I'm goin' all out
I'll reach in your chest to pull your heart out
Don't hesitate, just fall into me, my girl
The stars collide
When you and I
Intertwine
For the first time
The stars collide
When you and I
Intertwine
For the first time
